# SOFTEC Asia 2026 · Agentic QCSD Workshop

Welcome 👋 This is the official repo for the **Agentic Quality-Conscious Software Delivery (QCSD)** hands-on workshop at **SOFTEC Asia 2026** (MSTB), Kuala Lumpur.

**Session MR305 · Tuesday 15 September 2026 · 13:30 to 17:30 · Facilitator: Lalitkumar Bhamare**

**Agentic QCSD** is about putting autonomous AI quality agents to work *across the whole delivery lifecycle* — not just generating tests, but reasoning about requirements, product risk, code quality, security, and accessibility the way a quality engineer would. In this session you'll drive a fleet of these agents (**[Agentic QE](https://github.com/proffesor-for-testing/agentic-qe)**) through four SDLC phases, watch what they surface *on their own*, and then judge their output with the **PACT** lens (Proactive, Autonomous, Collaborative, Targeted).

The catch: great agents need something real to chew on. So this repo also ships a small, deliberately-flawed e-commerce app as the **subject under test** — see [The demo app](#the-demo-app) below.

## What you'll do

A short warm-up plus four SDLC exercises and a self-learning close — all copy-paste, in **[LAB.md](./LAB.md)**. The four phases build on each other (Refinement's ideas feed Development's tests; CI/CD verifies the result), and every exercise **persists what it learns** so the fleet's memory grows as you go:

| Step | Agent(s) / tool | The question it answers |
|------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| **0 · Warm-up** | `aqe code index src/` (your terminal) | Build a knowledge-graph map of the code and a clean memory baseline. Runs locally, no API key, about two seconds. |
| **1 · Ideation** | ideation gate (quality-criteria + risk + requirements) | Before any code — can a QE even do their job with these requirements? GO / CONDITIONAL / NO-GO. |
| **2 · Refinement** | `qe-product-factors-assessor` | What is this product really made of (SFDIPOT), and where's the risk? |
| **3 · Development** | `qe-test-architect` | Can it turn those ideas into strong, runnable tests for the riskiest module? |
| **4 · CI/CD** | `qe-queen-coordinator` (verify) | Is this releasable? Coverage + security + a 90% gate → GO / CONDITIONAL / NO-GO. |
| **5 · Self-Learning** | AQE memory | Put memory to work: have the fleet consolidate everything it learned into an instant onboarding / handoff brief. |

The four SDLC exercises have **two prompt versions** — one for **Claude Code users** (skills / orchestrator) and one for **non-Claude-Code users** (generic step list) — so they work on any tool; Steps 0 and 5 are MCP-tool calls identical everywhere. You then **Apply PACT** to score each agent's output, and finish with a **Personal Adoption Roadmap**. Everything is kept lean and token-cheap so a whole room can run it on personal keys.

## Before you arrive

Four hours is not enough time to fix a laptop. Please get through Setup at home.

- **Node.js 20 or newer, and npm 10 or newer.** Check with `node -v` and `npm -v`. AQE 3.14 declares Node 22.13 in its `engines` field, so on Node 20 npm prints an `EBADENGINE` warning and installs anyway. Verified on Node 20.20.2: install, `aqe init`, the code index and the test suite all behave identically to Node 22. The one setup that does fail is npm with `engine-strict=true`, which turns that warning into an error; there, use Node 22.13 or newer.
- **Rights to install a global npm package.** Setup runs `npm install -g agentic-qe`. If your machine blocks that, bring a laptop that does not.
- **A coding agent you already use, signed in and working.** Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, AWS Kiro, OpenAI Codex CLI, Windsurf, Cline, OpenCode, Kilo Code, Roo Code or Continue.dev. AQE drives whichever one you have, through one MCP server.
- **Your own model access.** Steps 1 to 5 spend your tokens on your own key or subscription. Step 0 spends none. Budget about what an hour of ordinary agent use costs you.
- **Do the whole of Setup before the session,** including `aqe code index src/`. Conference wifi and corporate proxies are the two things most likely to break it, and neither is fixable from the front of the room.
- **Optional: a real project of your own.** The closing exercise plans adoption for your context. You do not need to open your employer's code in the room to do it.

## Setup

**1. Get this repo.** Clone it (or download the ZIP from the green **Code** button and unzip), then move into the folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fndlalit/SOFTEC-Agentic-QCSD-Workshop
cd SOFTEC-Agentic-QCSD-Workshop
```

> **Clone close to your home folder.** The code indexer skips any file more than ten directories deep, so `~/SOFTEC-Agentic-QCSD-Workshop` works and `~/Documents/Conferences/2026/SOFTEC/workshops/...` silently drops the API routes from the knowledge graph.

**2. Install AQE and the demo app's dependencies.** Run these once, from inside the folder:

```bash
npm install -g agentic-qe@3.14.1   # the AQE CLI (global, one-time)
aqe init --auto                    # set up AQE for YOUR coding agent — see the table below
npm install                        # the demo app's own dependencies
```

`aqe init --auto` configures **Claude Code** by default. Using a different coding agent? Add the matching flag — AQE works with **11 platforms** through a single MCP server:

| Coding agent | `aqe init` command |
|--------------|--------------------|
| **Claude Code** | `aqe init --auto` (built-in) |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `aqe init --auto --with-copilot` |
| **Cursor** | `aqe init --auto --with-cursor` |
| **Cline** | `aqe init --auto --with-cline` |
| **OpenCode** | `aqe init --auto --with-opencode` |
| **AWS Kiro** | `aqe init --auto --with-kiro` |
| **Kilo Code** | `aqe init --auto --with-kilocode` |
| **Roo Code** | `aqe init --auto --with-roocode` |
| **OpenAI Codex CLI** | `aqe init --auto --with-codex` |
| **Windsurf** | `aqe init --auto --with-windsurf` |
| **Continue.dev** | `aqe init --auto --with-continuedev` |

```bash
aqe init --auto --with-all-platforms   # or just set up everything at once
```

**4. Build the code knowledge graph.** Two commands in your terminal, before you open your coding agent:

```bash
aqe code index src/     # expect: 21 files indexed, 102 nodes, 117 edges, ~2s
aqe hg stats            # the same graph, counted by node type
aqe memory usage        # your starting baseline: 21 entries, 102 vectors
```

This is static analysis plus a local embedding model. It needs no API key and spends no tokens. Run it in the terminal rather than asking your agent to do it, so the agent does not pay to relay the output.

**Optional, and your call: the memory layer.** Steps 1 to 5 each end with "Save learnings and persist patterns", and step 5 reads those patterns back. On a default install nothing is saved: AQE has no embedder, so the pattern store refuses to write and you get `VECTOR_SPACE_UNVERIFIED`. Two ways to turn it on:

```bash
npm install -g @huggingface/transformers@4.2.0   # local embedder, 384-dim all-MiniLM-L6-v2
# or point AQE at an embedding service you already trust:
export AQE_EMBEDDER_ENDPOINT=...
```

Read this before you run it: AQE flags that package as an explicit security opt-in, because its dependency chain currently carries two unresolved HIGH advisories (GHSA-xcpc-8h2w-3j85, GHSA-f88m-g3jw-g9cj). Skip it on a work machine. Step 5 has a fallback that works without it, and everything in steps 0 to 4 works either way.

With the embedder in place you can also load the seed brain, so step 5 has substance even if an earlier step failed:

```bash
aqe learning import -i seed/aqe-seed-patterns.json
aqe learning stats     # confirms the patterns are stored
```

**5. Launch your coding agent in this folder** — Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, Kiro, Codex, Windsurf… whichever you have. This folder is your workspace root; all paths in LAB.md are relative to it.

➡️ **Next:** open **[LAB.md](./LAB.md)** and start with Exercise 1.

## The demo app

A six-product electronics storefront with a complete purchase flow — the *subject under test*, not the point of the workshop. It deliberately contains realistic quality issues (validation gaps, accessibility misses, fragile payment-retry logic, weak input handling) for the agents to find.

- **Catalog** (`src/app/page.tsx`, `src/lib/products.ts`) — product grid with add-to-cart.
- **Cart** (`src/app/cart`, `src/context/CartContext.tsx`) — client-side state via React context + reducer.
- **Checkout** (`src/app/checkout`, `src/components/CheckoutForm.tsx`) — address + payment form (Stripe Elements), validation, guest checkout.
- **Confirmation** (`src/app/confirmation`) — post-purchase summary.
- **API routes** (`src/app/api`) — `create-payment-intent` and `orders`.
- **Libraries** (`src/lib`) — card/Luhn validation, form/email validation, guest sessions, rate limiting, payment-retry with backoff, order-event publishing.

**Tech stack:** Next.js 14 (App Router) · React 18 · TypeScript · Stripe · Tailwind CSS · Vitest + Testing Library.

Test coverage is **intentionally uneven** — some modules and UI states are left untested on purpose, so there's real work for the agents.

**Run the existing tests (optional):**

```bash
npm run test:run        # single run
npm run test:coverage   # with coverage
```
