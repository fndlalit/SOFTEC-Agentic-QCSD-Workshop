# Troubleshooting

Detail behind the short notes in [LAB.md](./LAB.md). You do not need any of this to
run the workshop — it is here for anyone who hits one of these and wants to know why.

## `aqe learning import` prints the same thing whether it worked or not

The import always finishes with output of this shape:

```
  Total patterns: 6
  Imported: 0
  Skipped: 6
```

The CLI counts a pattern as "skipped" whenever the optional ANN index cannot be
opened — including when SQLite, the authoritative store, took the write. So
`Imported: 0` tells you nothing either way.

`aqe learning stats` is the reliable check:

- **`Total: 0`** — there is no embedder, nothing was stored, and nothing will be
  until one is installed. See setup step 5 in the [README](./README.md), then
  re-run the import.
- **`Total: 76`** — it worked: AQE's own foundational patterns plus your six. Do
  not re-run the import.

Both cases were confirmed on this repo with agentic-qe 3.14.1, on one machine with
the embedder present and with it removed.

## `VECTOR_SPACE_UNVERIFIED` and `brain.rvf`

The persistent vector index stays unverified without native RuVector provenance,
and AQE falls back to SQLite. SQLite is authoritative, so patterns are stored; only
the approximate-nearest-neighbour index is skipped. `brain.rvf.corrupt-NNNN` files
in `.agentic-qe/` are quarantined empty indexes, not lost data.

## Memory through the MCP tools on non-Claude agents

Claude Code captures and recalls learnings through the ReasoningBank hooks. Other
agents go through the `memory_store` / `memory_query` MCP tools, and in 3.14.1 that
round-trip is unreliable: `memory_store` can write without returning a response, and
`memory_retrieve` may not read the key back. Loading the seed brain and confirming
`aqe learning stats` reads 76 is the supported path for Exercise 5 on those tools.

## Coverage reads about 38%

Your clone predates the test-scope fix, so AQE's own scaffolding is being counted in
the denominator. `git pull`, then `npm run test:coverage` again. The app reads
**61.62%** overall, and `src/lib/payment-retry.ts` reads 100% of statements and
97.29% of branches.
